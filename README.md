Questions:

a.x = u*0.125

b.y = v*0.125

c. white

I made the first cube with 179.jpg file and 179norm.jpg and following the directions
I made the second cube on the x=-2 with only 179.jpg
Then I added the third cube on y=2 x=-2 with 158.jpg and 158norm.jpg
All three of the cubes are shone with slowly moving lights from left to right.

Forth cube is created with the loader function and 156.jpg.
It's using the vertexShader and fragmentShader.

Then I made the fifth cube with another loader function and seperate vshader and fragshader with 191.jpg.
